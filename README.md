- 👋 Hi, I’m @jaskut
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new skills, full-stack whatever, I don't care as long as it's coding
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development, in general how big projects are organized
- ☄️ I already have experience with python and java as well as html, css, javascript and typescript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun creative projects, nothing commercial I suppose, except if you pay well 🤑 I'm still quite unexperienced though, at least when it comes to big, collaborative projects
- 📫 How to reach me: 02_journey.elf@icloud.com
